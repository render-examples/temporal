# Temporal 

This is a template for running a production-ready Temporal cluster on Render, that supports independent autoscaling for each Temporal service (frontend, matching, history, worker). The setup also includes an ElasticSearch instance, and an example Go app that can trigger and run workflows. Fork this repo and then click the button below to try it out!

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

This repo defines a [Render Blueprint](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec) with the following components:
- Temporal cluster:
  - A postgres DB.
  - An ElasticSearch instance, for [advanced visibility](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/content/what-is-advanced-visibility/).
  - A [private service](https://render.com/docs/private-services) for each Temporal service: frontend, matching, history, and worker.
  - The Temporal web UI.
- Example app (based on Temporal's [Go SDK Example](https://github.com/temporalio/money-transfer-project-template-go)):
  - `app-workflow-trigger` runs a simple HTTP server with two routes:
    - `/` for health checking.
    - `/trigger-workflow` for kicking off the `TransferMoney` workflow.
  - `app-worker` executes any triggered workflows.

You may also wish to tweak the autoscaling parameters of the Temporal cluster services, which are currently defined as:
```yaml
scaling:
  minInstances: 2
  maxInstances: 3
  targetMemoryPercent: 80
  targetCPUPercent: 80
```

# Deploy Steps

1. Click the "Deploy to Render" button.
2. In your Render dashboard, click on the service `app-workflow-trigger`, and copy its URL. Let's say it's `https://app-workflow-trigger.onrender.com/`.
3. To verify that your Temporal cluster is running correctly, you can use Temporal's CLI tool `tctl`. There are two ways to access `tctl` provided on the `temporal-all` (`temporal-frontend` if you're using `render.with_scaling.yaml`) service:
    - Using [SSH](https://render.com/docs/ssh).
    - Using the web shell:
      ![web-shell](./assets/temporal-shell.png)
    
   Some commands to run (with expected, non-exact output):
    ```bash
    $ tctl cluster health
    temporal.api.workflowservice.v1.WorkflowService: SERVING
    $ tctl admin membership list_gossip  # list all temporal services.
    [
      {
        "role": "frontend",
        "member_count": 1,
        "members": [
          {
            "identity": "10.129.8.40:10000"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "role": "history",
        "member_count": 1,
        "members": [
          {
            "identity": "10.129.8.40:7234"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "role": "matching",
        "member_count": 1,
        "members": [
          {
            "identity": "10.129.8.40:7235"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "role": "worker",
        "member_count": 1,
        "members": [
          {
            "identity": "10.129.8.40:7239"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```
4. Go to `https://app-workflow-trigger.onrender.com/`. If everything is well, you will see "OK!".
5. Now trigger the example workflow by visiting `https://app-workflow-trigger.onrender.com/trigger-workflow`. It should print
    ```
    Transfer of $54.990002 from account 001-001 to account 002-002 is processing. ReferenceID: 5e1f48db-5021-4e05-adb6-8bca54587d40

    WorkflowID: transfer-money-workflow RunID: 3179d644-4235-4ea8-b1a4-b7c4fabb0afd
    ```
6. `app-worker` will immediately pick up and run this workflow. You can verify by clicking on the service, and going to the "Logs" tab:
![app-worker-logs](./assets/worker-logs.png)
7. To check that the workflow has been run successfully, click on the `temporal-web` service, and go to its URL. Under the `default` namespace, you should find your workflow's run with the status "Completed".
